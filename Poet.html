And when he becomes a big boy he says that when he finishes college he will be happy. And when he finishes college he says that when he gets his first job he will be happy. And when he gets his first job he says that when he gets married, then he will be happy. And when he gets married he says when the kids get out of school he will be happy. And when the kids get out of school, he says that when he retires, he will be happy. And when he retires, what does he see? He sees, life has just gone by, in front of his eyes. It is too late.<br>

Some people practice procrastination by hiding behind high-sounding words, saying "I' m analysing" a month later and six months later they are still analysing. What they don't realise is that they are suffering from a disease called: Paralysis by Analysis and they will never succeed. <br>

Then there is another breed of people who procrastinate by saying "I'm getting ready." A month later they are still getting ready and six months later they are still getting ready. They say "I'll do it when I become an expert." They don't understand that unless you do it, you'll never become an expert. They keep making excuses.<br>

<p> <h2> “WHETHER OR NOT YOU WIN THIS THING, YOU’VE GOT TO DECIDE how you are going to walk out of here when it is all said and done….Because the game is going to go on.<br>

And there is only one rule you need to now about, there are no second chances.<br>

There is only this moment, and the next moment. Every one of those moments is a test…that you get to take one time, and ONLY ONE TIME!<br>

So, if you see an opening, tear into it!<br>

If you get a shot at victory, make damn sure you take it!<br>

SEIZE THAT MOMENT!<br>

That moment is a crossroads where everything you want will collide with everything standing in your way!</h2></p>
